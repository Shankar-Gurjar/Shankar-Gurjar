# Hi there, I'm Shankar Gurjar 👋

I'm passionate about Machine Learning, Data Science, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

I love exploring how AI can solve real-world problems and create new possibilities. Always excited to learn and share cool projects!

# 👨‍🎓🙋‍♂️ About Me 💼🎒:

🔭 I hold a Masters Degree in applied data science with a specialisation in machine learning, Deep learning & Generative AI from Clarkson University and I have 6+ years of experience building and deploying machine learning and deep learning applications.

I have a strong practical and theoretical experience in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

🔭 Some of the projects I have delivered and that helped in gaining strong hands on expertise include:

* Customer Segmentation 
* Product Recommendation engines
* Fraud Detection
* Risk assessment & Claims prediction
* Product Demand Forecasting
* Investment Portfolio stress testing
* Customer Churn Prediction
* Lifetime Value Prediction
* Fraud Detection in Healthcare Billing Systems
* Disease Diagnosis
* Price optimization & Personalized marketing
* AI-based chatbot development & Service operations optimization


🔭 I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Below are some used models:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Decision Trees (DT)
* Random Forests (RF)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Deep Neural Networks
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
* Naive Bayes (NB)
* Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)
* XGBoost
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

🔭 Below are some state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series forecasting models used in various real-time projects:

* Auto-Regressive (AR) Model
* Auto-Regressive Moving Averages (ARMA) Model
* Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) Model
* Neural Hierarchical Interpolation of Time Series (N-HiTS) Model
* Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) Model
* The Prophet Forecasting Model by Facebook

🔭 Furthermore, below are some of the tools used during my experience for Generative AI:

* Langchain
* LangGraph
* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Llama Index
* OpenAI API
* Mixtral (LLM)
* Llama 2 (LLM)
* GPT - 3 (LLM)
* GPT - 3.5 (LLM)
* GPT - 4 (LLM)

# 🪚🔧 My Skills 😀😀:

These valuable tools and techniques have empowered me to successfully develop and comprehend intricate machine learning projects.
